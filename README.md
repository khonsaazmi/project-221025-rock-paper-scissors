**Project Diary**

Today I want to reach my daily goal. I'm having insomnia because of it T.T. I feel like I'm enjoying this activity more and more. Hopefully, my study rhythm will improve so I don't get sick.

In this project, I trained myself to be diligent in doing "commits" on git using messages that other programmers might understand when I collaborate someday.
